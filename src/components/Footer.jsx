      <p>Planet Earth is not the only place with a litter issue. Beyond our atmosphere,  in the expanse of the Milky Way Galaxy, there is already a significant amount of space waste, or space debris. These space debris are a fragments from rockets, satellites, and other creations that have been sent to space. The large issue with this, however, is that there have been instances of the debris falling back through the atmosphere colliding into the ground. R’Cat aims to spread awareness about this pressing issue in hopes of inspiring people to take action, to prevent potential damage and larger issues.</p>
